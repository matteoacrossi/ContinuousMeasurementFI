    (t, FI, QFI) = Eff_QFI_PD(Nj, Ntraj, Tfinal, dt; kwargs... )

Evaluate the continuous-time FI and QFI of a final strong measurement for the
estimation of the frequency ω with continuous photo-detection monitoring
of each half-spin particle affected by noise at an angle θ,
with efficiency η using SME (stochastic master equation).

The function returns a tuple `(t, FI, QFI)` containing the time vector and the
vectors containing the FI and average QFI

# Arguments

* `Nj`: number of spins
* `Ntraj`: number of trajectories for the SSE
* `Tfinal`: final time of evolution
* `dt`: timestep of the evolution
* `κ = 1`: the noise coupling
* `θ = 0`: noise angle (0 parallel, π/2 transverse)
* `ω = 0`: local value of the frequency
* `η = 1`: measurement efficiency
